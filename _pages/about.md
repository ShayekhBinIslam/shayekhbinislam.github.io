<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am broadly interested in natural language processing and machine learning. My research involves complex reasoning, language agents, preference optimization and parameter-efficient systems for real-world problems using deep neural networks.

I have been collaborating with [Cohere For AI](https://cohere.com/research), [Ai2](https://allenai.org/), and [Salesforce Research](https://www.salesforceairesearch.com/) which led to a publication in EMNLP'24 (first-author), , ICLR'25 (Spotlight, co-author) and submissions in ACL'25 (first-author), NAACL'25, and ICCV'25. During the [Fatima Fellowship 2023](https://www.fatimafellowship.com/) program, I was fortunate to work with [Mohamed El Banani](https://mbanani.github.io/) from the University of Michigan and World Labs. I completed my Bachelor's in [Computer Science]((https://cse.buet.ac.bd/)) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).
