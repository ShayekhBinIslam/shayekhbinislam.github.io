## Designing Robot Operating System Materials

- Introduction to Robot Operating System (ROS)
  - Acquainting learners with the fundamentals of Robot Operating System (ROS) using
**ROS Noetic Ninjemys** distribution.
  - Covering the concepts of nodes, messages, topics, and services utilizing the **turtlesim** package.
  - Introducing basic shell commands for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa).

- ROS Packages and Topics
  - Fundamentals of ROS packages and topics utilizing the **Husky** simulator.
  - Concepts from building a basic package to running nodes in that package containing a simple ROS.

- Forward Kinematics in ROS
  - Implementing the forward kinematics of **UR5**, an industrial robot system, in Python.
  - Visualization of the robot's movements in the Gazebo simulator.

- Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) Controller in ROS
  - Implementing of a PID controller of **Hector**, a drone robot system, in Python and C++.
  - Developing a remote-control system for the drone in Python.



## Thesis Co-Supervised

- A Scalable Bitcoin Blockchain Network by Dynamic Block Size Adjustment using RL.
  - Proposing a dynamic block size adjustment system that maximizes the miner's revenue based on the condition of the blockchain network.
  - Benchmarking online, offline, and inverse RL algorithms in the blockchain domain.

- Mitigating Occupation Bias in Language Models.
  - Proposing a method to mitigate the occupation bias in Language models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT via continual pre-training with gender-balanced synthetic datasets.
